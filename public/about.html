                <p>This project began as a 'what if' experiment to imagine if software could measure conversational tone in real time.</p>
                <p>It uses <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/speech-to-text.html">Watson Speech to Text</a> and <a href="https://tone-analyzer-demo.mybluemix.net/">Watson Tone Analyzer</a>.
                    <p> The objective of the project is to <strong>sample and visual the emotion in an ongoing conversation</strong></p>

                    <p>Clicking on the record button should open your computers microphone. If you speak aloud, your words will be written on the green rectangle (grille) area of the app. </p>
                    <p>After a minute or so of continual spoken words, the tone analyzer should be able to feed back emotional strengh and a line graph will plot in the area at the top of the app.</p>

            <div id="panelb" class="panel">
                <p>Alternatively, you can press the play button, and listen to a prerecorded message ( <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/text-to-speech.html">Watson Text to Speech</a> )</p>

                <p> There are also controls to toggle between the different measurement approaches Watson Tone Analyzer offers.</p>
